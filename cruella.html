  <div class="character-description">

    <h2>Fashion as a Way to Survive the Industry</h2>
    <p>
      Cruella’s journey is built around one truth:  
      <strong>women in creative industries are often underestimated until they shock the room.</strong>  
      In fashion — a field dominated by hierarchy, gatekeeping, and elitism — she uses clothing as
      the only language that the industry cannot ignore.  
      Every outfit she wears is a protest, a punch, or a statement demanding visibility.
    </p>

    <h2>The Black & White Palette — A Woman Split by Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      Her signature black-and-white look represents the conflict every woman faces in male-controlled,
      rule-bound spaces:  
      <em>“Be soft, but strong. Be talented, but not threatening. Be creative, but follow the rules.”</em>  
      Cruella refuses this contradiction. She makes the contrast louder, bigger, sharper —  
      turning what society sees as “too much” into her strongest visual identity.
    </p>

    <h2>The Garbage Truck Dress – Taking Up Space</h2>
    <p>
      This outfit isn’t about drama — it’s about taking up physical space in a world that keeps
      shrinking women down.  
      The flowing red fabric pouring from the garbage truck symbolizes how women’s
      work is often dismissed as “waste” until it’s finally recognised.  
      Cruella flips that narrative:  
      <strong>She turns what they threw away into something unforgettable.</strong>
    </p>

    <h2>The Fire Dress – Burning Down Expectations</h2>
    <p>
      When she burns away the plain white dress to reveal a bold red gown, it becomes a metaphor for
      every woman who has been forced into simplicity, humility, or politeness to be accepted.  
      The red dress is a refusal.  
      A refusal to dim talent.  
      A refusal to dress “appropriately.”  
      A refusal to follow the standards designed by people in power.  
      This look marks her transition from playing the industry’s game to rewriting it.
    </p>

    <h2>The Military Jacket – A Woman Going to War</h2>
    <p>
      The structured jackets, metallic detailing, and sharp silhouettes reflect the reality of women
      constantly fighting for credit, space, and authority in creative environments.  
      While her male counterparts are seen as “visionaries,”  
      women are often labelled emotional, dramatic, or difficult.  
      Cruella uses fashion to claim the authority she’s denied.
    </p>

    <h2>Fashion as a Weapon, Not Decoration</    h2>
    <p>
      Cruella does not dress to be beautiful — she dresses to be undeniable.  
      She understands what many women in competitive industries realise:  
      <strong>when the system won’t give you power, you build power out of what you have.</strong>  
      For Cruella, that power is clothing.  
      Her outfits don’t make her softer — they make her louder, sharper, and more visible.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Her Story Matters for Women Today</h2>
    <p>
      Cruella is not a symbol of perfection.  
      She’s a symbol of a woman who refuses to shrink for a world that wants her silent.  
      Her fashion represents courage, rebellion, and the right to take up space —  
      all of which reflect the struggles women face across industries even today.  
      She shows that style can be more than expression —  
      <strong>it can be resistance, independence, and self-definition.</strong>
