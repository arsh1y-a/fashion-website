      <h2>Her Transformation</h2>

      <p>
        Andy’s journey in <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> is one of the most iconic
        fashion transformations in film — not because she becomes stylish, but
        because she learns to negotiate identity, ambition, and self-worth.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the beginning, Andy stands as an outsider in the fashion world. Her 
        clothes are intentionally oversized, practical, and almost resistant to 
        the aesthetic around her. This visual resistance mirrors her internal 
        belief: that fashion is shallow. Her wardrobe communicates comfort over 
        conformity, but also insecurity — she hides in layers, unaware of how 
        clothing can be a language rather than a disguise.
      </p>

      <p>
        As she enters Runway, she confronts a culture where power is communicated 
        through precision. Every heel, every coat, every belt is a declaration. 
        Andy’s transformation begins not when she changes her outfit, but when 
        she starts observing the women around her: confident, bold, and unapologetic. 
        She realizes fashion isn’t frivolous — it’s armor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Her makeover scene is iconic, not because she suddenly becomes “beautiful,” 
        but because she finally tries. The sleek boots, the tailored coats, the 
        chic color palettes — they represent her willingness to step into a world 
        she had previously dismissed. Her outfits grow sharper, more structured, 
        mirroring the way she adapts, learns, and excels.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the most important part of her arc is the moment fashion stops being 
        a costume and becomes a mirror. As she climbs higher at Runway, her looks 
        become almost intimidatingly polished — but her relationships begin to 
        crack. The transformation isn’t “good” or “bad”; it’s complex. It shows 
        how ambition requires sacrifice.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the end, Andy rejects the idea that she must choose between being 
        fashionable or being herself. She walks away from Runway with a sense of 
        self-respect and clarity. The last outfit we see her in is effortless yet 
        refined — a balance between who she was and who she has become.
      </p>

      <p>
        Andy’s transformation isn’t simply about clothes. It’s about ownership — 
        of her choices, her identity, and her voice. Fashion becomes a tool, not 
        a trap. And that is what makes her story timeless.
