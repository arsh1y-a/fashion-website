            <h3>Before: Rani in Paris – holding back her voice</h3>
            <p>
                At the beginning of Queen, Rani dresses in a way that reflects everything she has been taught:
                modesty, politeness, and staying "within limits."  
                Her clothes are simple, traditional, and muted — not because she likes them,
                but because she has been conditioned to believe that this is how a “good girl” should appear.
                <br><br>
                Her posture is closed, her arms folded, her expressions unsure.  
                These are not just personality traits — they symbolize a lifetime of being told to shrink herself,
                to prioritize others' expectations over her own desires.
                <br><br>
                The clothes become a metaphor for how confined she feels internally — stitched into boundaries she never chose.

            <h3>After: The Pink Sleeveless Gown – owning her freedom</h3>
            <p>
                The pink sleeveless gown is not just a costume — it is a turning point.
                Everything about this outfit carries symbolism:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Sleeveless:</b> She is no longer hiding or shrinking. Her body language becomes open, soft, and free.</li>
                <li><b>Pink:</b> A color that people often associate with fragility — but here it becomes a symbol of power, joy, and rebellion.</li>
                <li><b>Flowing fabric:</b> It mirrors the emotional release she experiences as she lets go of fear and expectations.</li>
                <li><b>Movement:</b> She is running, not waiting. Taking life forward with her own steps.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                This outfit comes after she begins discovering the world on her own terms —  
                making friends, making mistakes, laughing freely, and finally seeing herself as someone
                who deserves joy instead of permission.
                <br><br>
                The gown represents the moment she reclaims her identity.
                It marks the shift from “Rani who lives for others” to “Rani who chooses herself.”
                <br><br>
                And the beauty of this transformation is that she doesn’t become someone else.
                She becomes more herself than ever before.
